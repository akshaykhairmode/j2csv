### *Examples,*

#### Normal stream

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv  -f  test-files/object.txt
    
    //Output
    10:26PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/object.txt
    10:26PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-object-1672678561.csv
    10:26PM INF Done!!, Time took : 44.8119ms

#### JSON array stream

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv -a -f test-files/array.json
    
    //Output
    10:28PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/array.json
    10:28PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-array-1672678733.csv
    10:28PM INF Done!!, Time took : 32.2386ms

#### Standard Input

    echo -n '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}' | ./dist/linux64/j2csv -i
    
    //Output
    10:34PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-stdin-1672679072.csv
    10:34PM INF Done!!, Time took : 341.8Âµs

#### With Force flag, loads the input file in memory instead of streaming. Should be used when conversion is failing

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv -f test-files/object_fail.txt -force
    
    //Output
    10:35PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/object_fail.txt
    10:35PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-object_fail-1672679154.csv
    10:35PM INF Done!!, Time took : 70.8357ms

#### Zip Output

zip input is by default supported **(Only works with single file in zip)**. For zip output use -z.

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv -z -f test-files/object.zip
    
    //Output
    10:38PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/object.zip
    10:38PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-object-1672679327.zip
    10:38PM INF Done!!, Time took : 37.0841ms

#### With custom output path

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv -f test-files/object.zip -o myfile.csv
    
    //Output
    10:43PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/object.zip
    10:43PM INF Output File ====> myfile.csv
    10:43PM INF Done!!, Time took : 40.0745ms

#### Converting unix timestamp to string

    ./dist/linux64/j2csv -f test-files/object.zip -uts createdAt,updatedAt
    
    //Output
    10:44PM INF Reading input from path : test-files/object.zip
    10:44PM INF Output File ====> j2csv-object-1672679695.csv
